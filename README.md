This Java program that is written by Tat Putjorn 672115024 reads and analyzes any text file then prints various statistics: total character count, number of palindromes, token count, emoticon count, new line count, the longest and average token length, plus total execution time. Each token is checked for palindromes by ignoring punctuation and case, and emoticons are recognized from a short list (e.g., “:-)”, “:d”). After all data is collected, the program outputs the results in a simple format and concludes with “Program terminated properly!”

Output: 

Program start:
Total # Character count: 2279
Total # Palindrome found: 21
Total Number of tokens: 374
Total Number of emoticon: 2
Total # of new line: 15
The longest and average token size token 31 5.1
Total time to execute this program 0.1secs

Program terminated properly!
